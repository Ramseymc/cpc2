(floorplan and fileDepositPop - these can also be fixed throughout the day so be chilled and trust that, Wayne is helping too)
	  note any extra bugs


fileDepositPop - how is this any different from the other files?
  just comment out existing fileDepPop go and copy the code for another file and rename it (fileDepPop) , create it and place into the methods x2(updateClient formAppend and insertClient formAppend) routes x2(update updateClientCM and createClientCM) , there may be a silly error somewhere


finalize Pricing mechanism - just try it with the new Edit / Update - Wayne might need to do this	  

 any null data in form
