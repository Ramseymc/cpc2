{ work flow process today
	Done: Send Wayne my ClientUpsert and SalesInfo, and SalesStart, and ask if he can please try to get the 
	  finalizeCosts to work 
	WIP at work -> While i debug the floorPlans not appearing in edit mode (UnitValue being passed in must come from   unit in the salesEditData[])
	  
		Ask Wayne to Please Code share when he has a moment, go tell Debbie what is up :) 

	  NB say hi to Debs, gonna get it ready to go through every possible scenario with you, just 2 small things i would like to look at quickly
	  (floorplan and fileDepositPop - these can also be fixed throughout the day so be chilled and trust that, Wayne is helping too)
	  note any extra bugs
	fileDepositPop - how is this any different from the other files?
	  just comment out existing fileDepPop go and copy the code for another file and rename it (fileDepPop) , create it and place into the methods x2(updateClient formAppend and insertClient formAppend) routes x2(update updateClientCM and createClientCM) , there may be a silly error somewhere

	 debug and show Debbie when she is ready, take any notes from her, will deploy when 
	 100% happy (they desnt know any better, and i can get the code working)

	 if there is time, move onto investors demo and notes (i need to copy the database into mine from desktop)
	 is the codebase latest ? and bug free, check this for myself as ill need to go through it tomorrow and fix it
	 will deploy when 100% happy 
}

1) the fileDepositPop document is not uploading via files 
  - this is an easy fix i am definitely overlooking or something :) 

ask Wayne for help here, I am busy with the fileDepositPop and getting th efloorplans to load in edit mode
2) finalize Pricing mechanism - just try it with the new Edit / Update - Wayne might need to do this

3) floorplans in editMode 
4) any null data in form
